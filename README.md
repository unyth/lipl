## What is it?

I am trying to follow Building Your Own Lisp by Daniel Holden as a means to learn to implement programming language and to improve my ability to program in C.

You can find Daniel Holden's book at http://www.buildyourownlisp.com/.

## Required packages in addition to a C compiler

You'll need the Editline library.

On Debian family of OS with apt:
```
sudo apt-get install libedit-dev
```

On Fedora family of OS with yum:
```
su -c "yum install libedit-dev"
```

You also need mpc library made by the author. You just need mpc.h and mpc.c file from the following git repo:

## Current Status

No more progress will be made on the project. I believe I have developed the programming skills that I wanted from doing this project. I want to learn more about programming languages (various paradigms as well as theory) before coming back to develop a good standard library for myself.
